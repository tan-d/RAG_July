# OpenAI - Developer

This VSCode Extension queries the OpenAI models [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog). The models currently implemented are ChatGPT and Codex. Other OpenAI models will be coming soon.

Each model has different capabilities and price points. Prices are per 1,000 tokens. You can think of tokens as pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens are about 750 words. See [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)
