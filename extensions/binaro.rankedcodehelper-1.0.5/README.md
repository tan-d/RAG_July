# OpenAI Wizard

Helps you refactor and change your code with the help of OpenAI API.
Open AI account is required for an API Key, which is required for this extension.

## Commands
* Use "OpenAI Wizard" commant to get response to prompt at caret location. If you have selected text. It will get used for the context of the message and replaced with the response.
* Refactor your whole file with "OpenAI Wizard File" command.
* Create a new file with context of the old file - "OpenAI Wizard New" command (great for commands like "crreate unit tests for this file").
* Set your OpenAI api key with "OpenAI Wizard Set api key" command.

## Disclaimer
* Be aware that this extension is in early development and we are still very limited by OpenAI apis limitations. 
* Running this extension will overwrite files you are working with, so using a git or other version control system is expected, otherwise YOU MIGHT LOOSE YOUR FILES!
* The structure of the file might not be preserved. The code might not work after update by OpenAI.
* Author of this extension is not responsible for quality of the code it generates. It is a very limited tool and you are using it on your own risk. Deploying code generated by this tool to production is dangerous and might lead to unintended consequences.
* This extension does send a code you are working with to third party - OpenAI. If the project you are working on is under Non-Disclosure Agreement, is copyrighted or its license limits its distribution in any other way, you should not use this extension as every command in this extension sends data and code to OpenAI api.

## Updates

### version 1.0.6 (not released yet)

Added button that will automatically populate git commit message based on existing git changes.
You can now set the "after prompt action" that will for example lint your file after the prompt is returned.

### version 1.0.5

Proper changelog.

### version 1.0.4

Security enhancements - proper apiKey storing.
You might need to run "OpenAI Wizard Set api key" command again to store your apiKey on new location.

### version 1.0.3

Changed the "OpenAI Wizard" to "OpenAI Wizard File" command. Changed the "Open AI Wizard Selection" command to "Open AI Wizard" command. As this command is useful not only for handling data with selection as context, but can also just return the response of a prompt. User can use prompts like "Give me a function, that will do XYZ" and it will be given at current caret location.

OpenAI will now receive the required language based on current file extension.

### version 1.0.2

Added the ability to generate completely new file. For example for unit tests generated for current file.

### version 1.0.1

Extended the number of tokens sent to api for processing larger files. Unfortunately, we still have limitations based on OpenAIs API.

Added working selection command.

### version 1.0.0

Basic functionality. Needs more testing.
